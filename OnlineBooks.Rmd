## Consumer Prices

### Headline consumer price inflation (整體消費物價通脹率)


### Underlying consumer price inflation (基本消費物價通脹率)
Underlying consumer price inflation is calculated by netting out the effects of all the Government’s one-off relief measures introduced since 2007, including the waiver and the Government’s payment of public housing rentals, rates concessions, the suspension and subsequent abolition of the Employees Retraining Levy, subsidies for household electricity charges, and waivers of examination fees.

計算基本消費物價通脹率時， 已撇除所有自二零零七年起實施的政府一次性紓緩措施所造成的效應； 這些措施包括公屋租金寬免和政府代繳公屋租金、差餉寬減、暫停和後來取消收取僱員再培訓徵款、住戶電費補貼， 以及考試費寬免。

### CPI and GDP deflator

The implicit price deflators of GDP and its main expenditure components are derived by
dividing GDP at current prices byponding chained-dollar figures. The rate of
change in the GDP deflator may differ substantially from that in the Composite CPI over
the same time span. The Composite CPI covers consumer price inflation in particular.
Yet the GDP deflator is a much broader measure of inflation for the entire economy, and
takes into account all the price changes related to consumption, investment, exports and
imports. Also, the rate of change in the GDP deflator may differ appreciably from that
in the total final demand deflator, depending on the movement in the prices of final
demand and imports. Likewise, the rate of change in the GDP deflator may differ
appreciably from that in the domestic demand deflator, depending on the movement in
the prices of imports and exports.





# External trade

## Terms of trade
Terms of trade are defined as the ratio between the index of export prices and the index of import prices. If the export prices increase more than the import prices, a country has a positive terms of trade, as for the same amount of exports, it can purchase more imports.

The terms of trade is defined as the ratio of the prices of total exports to the prices of total imports. (Source: C&SD publications)
